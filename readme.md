Geometric Design Software
This repository contains the executable file for Geometric Design Software Version 1.1. The software provides various tools and calculators for geometric design of roads, including stopping sight distance (SSD), overtaking sight distance (OSD), super elevation, and the length of various curves.

Features
1. Velocity Calculation
Allows users to calculate the design speed for both rural and urban roads under different terrain and rainfall conditions.
Converts between meters per second (m/s) and kilometers per hour (km/h).
2. Stopping Sight Distance (SSD)
Calculates the stopping sight distance for divided and undivided carriageways.
Takes into account the velocities of two vehicles, reaction times, friction factor, and gradient.
3. Overtaking Sight Distance (OSD)
Calculates the overtaking sight distance for different types of carriageways.
Considers multiple vehicle speeds, reaction time, acceleration, and number of lanes.
4. Design of Super Elevation
Calculates the super elevation for a given velocity and radius.
Outputs the super elevation, friction factor, and velocity in m/s.
5. Length of Transition Curve
Determines the length of the transition curve based on velocity, radius, gradient, number of lanes, and other parameters.
Provides extra widening details.
6. Length of Summit Curve
Computes the length of the summit curve for various sight distances.
Takes into account deviation angle, sight distance, eye height, and object height.
7. Length of Valley Curve
Calculates the length of the valley curve based on design speed, sight distance, deviation angle, and allowable rate of change of acceleration.
Considers both comfort condition and headlight sight distance.
